DFT analysis of doping effect at Pd and Co site in PdCoO2 delafossite. 

In this project, we simulated the doping by making 3*3*3 supercells containing a single impurity atom, i.e., 3.7% impurity concentration. The concentration is estimated considering computational expense to built larger supercells. Bandstructure and DOS calculations are performed using  Quantum ESPRESSO package. The obtained supercell bands are unfolded to determine the effect of these impurities on the bandstructure and DOS within the PdCoO2 primitive cell. The unfolding process is done using the [BandUPPY code](https://github.com/band-unfolding/banduppy). 

The detailed discussion of the result with experimental studies are discussed in our recent publication in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45239-6).
